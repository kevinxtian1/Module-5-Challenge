    "So our first day of VBA is behind us.  If you are familiar with programming you likely found that fairly easy, keep in mind the goal in us doing VBA first, is to establish good coding practice and to learn the fundamentals.  I can tell you, some very complex programs can be made with VBA, but we will save that for the more powerful languages like Python.  For now, focus on the four fundamentals and on thinking procedurally.   So even if you have coded for a long time, use this time to hone your \"best practices\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next class we will look at loops... a lot of loops.  Loops are important to master as you will run into them in one form or another throughout your data career.  After we learn loops we are going to have some activities that put all of this together!  \n",

    "  * Part 1: Calculate the total amount after adding in the fee, and enter the value in the \"Total\" cell.\n",

    "  * Part 2: Create a message box to alert the user if the total amount, including the fee, is within or over budget.\n",

    "  * Part 3 (Challenge): If the total is over budget, correct the price so it fits within the userâ€™s budget. Be sure to round down!\n",
    "\n",

    "The spreadsheet you'll be working with in this activity is full of animal inspired cryptocurrency! In place of numerical data, when you open your file you'll be greeted by cells filled with the words \"Shiba Inu\", \"Dogecoin\", or \"Cat Token\", however your crypto kennel is for canines only! Instead of manually removing the unwanted feline crypto, you'll use VBA to do the work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a VBA script to handle the over-abundance of the `Cat Token` currency in your spreadhseet's \"crypto kennel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are three parts to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Part 1:** Count the number of times `Cat Token` appears and display the number to your user in the form of a message box.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Part 2:** Modify the script such that it changes the word `Cat Token` to `Dogecoin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Part 3:** Modify the script a third time, this time keeping in mind that you have a limited number of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin`. Use the full set of `Shiba Inu` and `Dogecoin` you have available to replace all instances of `Cat Token`. If you run out of `Shiba Inu` or `Dogecoin` provide the user with the message: \"Oh no! We still have some Cat Token...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may want to create a backup of your spreadsheet as your macro will write over the contents.\n",

    "* Take lots of deep breaths!\n",
