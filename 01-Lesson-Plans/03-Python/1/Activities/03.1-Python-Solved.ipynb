    "**This week we will be introducing the Python programming language. The purpose of this unit is to gain a firm understanding on how to use the core Python language to store and manipulate data; read and write to files; and “translate” logical solutions to problems to Python implementations of those solutions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit will start out with core features of Python, such as variable declarations, and move on to discuss more advanced and idiomatic features of the language. Topics will include reading and writing files, working with the file system, iteration using for loops, iteration using list comprehension, list methods, the notion of dictionaries and methods on them, and additional miscellany where required to facilitate completion of the homework assignment.\n",
    "Make sure that you have all of your required course tools installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you will write in Python will eventually be seen by someone else. Focusing on organization and readability is important because you want colleagues to be able to read your code. If your code is poorly organized it will be difficult to read later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform their Python 3 installation.\n",
    "* Navigate through files and folders via the terminal.\n",
    "* Create Python scripts and run them in the terminal.\n",
    "* Understand basic programming concepts in Python.\n",
