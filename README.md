Module 5 Challenge
This project is comparing 4 different treatments on tumor growths within mice. Capomulin ended up being the most effective treatment. Analysis below:
The drug Capomulin appears to be effective at reducing cancer growth because the average tumor volume and weight were strongly positively correlated with an r value of around .82 . It along with Ramicane appeared to be the best treatments dueo to having the lowest tumor values in the boxplot with all the treatments. A low p-value indicates that it is statstically significant. As from the pie chart you can see that there is little biases of genders as they are near equal.
